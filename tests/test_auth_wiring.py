"""run.py must wire BOTH halves of dash-clerk-auth — the flexlayout class.

dash-clerk-auth splits its setup either side of ``Dash(...)``:
``register()`` loads the UI half (components, ClerkJS, appearance) and
``configure_app(app)`` registers the server half (``/api/auth/session``,
``/api/auth/signout``, the per-request identity population).

flexlayout shipped its batch-2 pass (2026-08-22) with the first call and
WITHOUT the second: every component rendered and ClerkJS reported
signed-in, while every server render read signed-out — the control board
served the owner the sign-in card forever, ``POST /api/auth/session``
answered 405 (the path fell through to Dash's GET-only page catch-all),
and sign-out never revoked. No suite could see it: Clerk is off in test
environments, and ``configure_app`` no-ops without keys, so the missing
call was indistinguishable from the deliberate no-op.

This pin is therefore STRUCTURAL — the wiring calls must exist in run.py
regardless of environment. The runtime half of the guard lives in
``scripts/smoke_live.py`` ("Auth wiring"), which proves the routes
actually answer on the deployed host.
