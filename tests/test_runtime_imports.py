"""Every runtime import must be declared — the clean-image witness.

A fork of this template died in production on ``ModuleNotFoundError: No
module named 'PIL'``: the package arrived with half the scientific stack,
so every machine it was tested on already had it — suite green, boots
locally, dies in a clean image. And because Dash imports every page while
constructing the app, one undeclared import in one docs example took the
whole site down. "Works here" and "works in a clean image" are different
claims, and the gap is always a package someone installed by hand months
ago. The fix is not discipline — it is this test, which reads the code
instead of trusting the interpreter's search path.

The check walks every runtime module (``lib/``, ``pages/``,
``components/``, ``docs/``, ``run.py``) and asserts each absolute import
resolves in the environment CI actually installs (requirements.txt and
nothing else). Nesting is deliberately ignored: the fatal PIL import was
function-local, so "only check module-level imports" would have missed it.
Nesting does not predict whether an import can kill a boot.

Exemptions are earned, not asserted. Each one carries a companion check
below proving the condition that makes it safe still holds — a comment
explaining why a rule doesn't apply decays; a test doesn't.
