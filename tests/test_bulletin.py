"""The network bulletin — wired, or off, and never a comment.

NETWORK FILE: adapted from dash-email (itself from
dash-documentation-boilerplate 1.2.4, where this existed because the wiring
had sat COMMENTED OUT in run.py for weeks against a hub endpoint that was
already serving). Nothing failed. `configure_bulletin` is opt-in, so an
unwired app makes no request at all and the viewer header renders perfectly
well on the package's built-in tips and a "No announcements." empty state.
The only symptom was an announcement that never appeared — which nobody goes
looking for.

The load-bearing test is the last one: commented-out wiring cannot define the
name it asserts on, so it fails the moment somebody comments it out again.
