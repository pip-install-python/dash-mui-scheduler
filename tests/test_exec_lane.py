"""`.. exec::` reaches the machine lane — the fourth empty-page mechanism.

Owner's decision 0aa (2026-08-31), road (a) with the dedupe rule, after the
item-18 fan-out found this class live on SIX forks: muicharts, pannellum,
muischeduler, email, flows and llms. The shape is always the same — a
directive that renders Dash components puts its output only in the React
tree, while the machine lane, the prerender and the crawler HTML are built
from the markdown SOURCE where the directive line is stripped. The page
looks perfect in a browser the entire time.

Measured on THIS host before the fix (the template's own numbers were
`/fastapi-showcase`): every `.. exec::` here rendered only into the React
tree, and 12 of the 34 carry `:code: false` — the option whose meaning the
template's first cut overrode. Its `/quickstart/llms.txt` carried 19,378
bytes of prose about three components whose code appeared nowhere in it.

Two roads answer this class and they now compose rather than collide:
(a) auto-render the exec'd module's SOURCE into the prose, through the same
fence-aware pass `.. source::` uses — one parse, two consumers; and
(b) hand-pair every `.. exec::` with a `.. source::` (modelviewer's road),
which four of this repo's five exec-using docs already took. The dedupe
rule is what makes (a) skip where (b) already applies.

A NOTE ON HOW THIS FILE IS WRITTEN. The round that produced it kept finding
pins that could not go red — a heading asserted instead of rows, a substring
counted instead of an element, a grep matching prose ABOUT the defect. So
every content pin here is mutation-checked, and the fixtures carry the
NEGATIVE cases (fenced, differently-targeted) rather than only the happy one.
