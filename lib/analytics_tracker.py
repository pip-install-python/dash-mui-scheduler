"""
Visitor Analytics Tracker
Tracks visitor information including device type, bot detection, and
whatever location the edge reported. It stores no raw addresses and makes no
outbound request of any kind.

This ledger is the raw material for two things:

1. the app's own record of who read the docs, and
2. the hourly rollup this app POSTs to 2plot.ai (``lib/satellite_reporter``),
   which is what the network ``/traffic`` dashboard charts.

Because the hub compares apps side by side, the fields written here match the
hub's own ledger exactly: ``{timestamp, path, device_type, user_agent,
visitor_key, bot_type?, ip_address?, location?}``. Crawler rows
(``device_type == "bot"``) additionally carry
``{vendor_key, vendor_class, verified, lane}`` since 1.6.34.

WHAT THIS SITE STORES ABOUT A VISITOR, stated here because the privacy page
QUOTES this paragraph rather than restating it (1.6.44 items 15 and 16):
the time, the path, a device type, the User-Agent string, and
``visitor_key`` — a keyed one-way hash of (client address + User-Agent),
truncated to 16 hex characters. **The address itself is not stored** unless
``ANALYTICS_KEEP_CLIENT_IP=1``. Location is whatever the EDGE told us
(Cloudflare's ``CF-*`` headers) and nothing else; there is no third-party
lookup and no configuration that turns one on.

Since 1.6.34 the same file holds a SECOND table, ``reads``: one row per
corpus document dash-improve-my-llms served, handed to :meth:`record_read`
through the package's ``on_document_read`` hook (2.8.0). ``visits`` is what
the request hook saw; ``reads`` is what the package says it served (tier,
verdict, bytes, verified vendor). They are joined by ``lib/traffic_rollup``
and never summed into each other.

THERE IS ONE CLASSIFIER — ``dash_improve_my_llms.classify()``. This module
carried its own User-Agent lists for a year; they filed ClaudeBot (Anthropic's
*training* crawler) under "search", still named the retired ``anthropic-ai`` /
``claude-web`` tokens, knew nothing of ``bytespider`` or ``Claude-User``, and
counted every UA-less or library client (``httpx``, ``Go-http-client``) as a
person. Every host in the fleet reported those numbers. The lists are gone:
``is_bot`` / ``detect_bot_type`` keep their names for callers and delegate. A
token the registry lacks is a pushback to the package, never a list here —
``tests/test_analytics_classifier.py`` greps this file for the old tokens.

Accuracy notes (these are the things that quietly wreck the numbers):

- **Network machinery is never a visitor.** Any request whose User-Agent
  carries ``lib.constants.INTERNAL_UA_TOKEN`` is dropped in ``track_visit``
  before device detection — the network's internal-traffic contract
  (https://2plot.ai/docs/satellite-analytics). ``/healthz`` is dropped there
  too. Both are write-time rules on purpose; see the comment in ``track_visit``.
- **No raw IP is stored** (1.6.44 item 16). The client address is still
  RESOLVED from the proxy headers (``CF-Connecting-IP``, ``X-Forwarded-For``,
  ...) — behind Cloudflare/Render ``remote_addr`` is the *proxy*, so a tracker
  that used it would collapse every visitor into one — and it is still what
  ``verified`` is computed against. It is then reduced to ``visitor_key`` and
  dropped. ``ANALYTICS_KEEP_CLIENT_IP=1`` keeps it: the same switch
  ``record_read`` has always honoured.
- **Location comes from the edge, never from a lookup.** ``CF-IPCountry``
  answers the country; ``CF-IPCity``, ``CF-Region``, ``CF-IPLatitude`` and
  ``CF-IPLongitude`` answer more where the zone's "Add visitor location
  headers" managed transform is on. Whatever ARRIVES is stored, whatever does
  not is absent. The ip-api.com path was REMOVED at 1.6.44, not defaulted
  off, because a disabled lookup is one environment variable away from an
  enabled one.
- **Writes are buffered, locked and pruned.** Multiple gunicorn/uvicorn workers
  share this file; without an ``flock`` around the read-modify-write they
  silently overwrite each other's hits. The buffer keeps a docs site from
  rewriting the whole file on every request, and retention keeps it bounded.

    * `visits` KEEPS the count cap. It is one row per pageview on a public

    * `reads` MUST NOT be capped by count. A single crawler sweep can serve

      table exists to record — and the deletion looks like the crawler
      simply not having come. Reads are pruned by DATE only; the retention
      window is the bound.

    The choice per table therefore lives at the CALL SITE, and it is
    source-pinned there by AST in tests/test_read_ledger.py: a behavioural
    test cannot see a `cap=True` restored above it.

    2.9.2; this repo's floor is 2.8.0, where `_ledger.EVENT_FIELDS` has 15
    keys and no class. `record_read` builds its row as
    `{k: event.get(k) for k in EVENT_FIELDS}`, so the key was dropped at the
    app boundary on every read and `lib/traffic_rollup`'s per-vendor `class`
    has been null for every vendor since the read table existed. Measured
    here: EVENT_FIELDS is 15 keys, `vendor_class` not among them.

    BOTH DIRECTIONS MATTER, which is why this is one function and not an
    `or`:

    * PREFER — where the package supplies a class, that value passes through
      UNTOUCHED, even when a local derivation would disagree. The package
      owns the registry; a host that "corrects" it is a second source of
      truth, and the fleet has one.

      registry (`vendors.get_vendor(key).cls`). Never a local map: a hand-kept
      table of vendor classes is exactly the mistake this repo's own history
      records one layer down, where a local User-Agent list filed Anthropic's
      training crawler as `search` for a year.
