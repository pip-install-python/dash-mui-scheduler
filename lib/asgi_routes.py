"""
FastAPI showcase routes for the documentation boilerplate.

The AI/LLM surfaces (``/llms.txt``, ``/<page>/llms.txt``, ``/robots.txt``,
``/sitemap.xml``) are mounted by ``dash-improve-my-llms`` 2.0 directly —
the package detects the FastAPI backend and registers its own router.
This module only carries the **showcase** surfaces that demonstrate
first-class OpenAPI integration under Dash 4.1+'s FastAPI backend:

- ``/healthz``       — liveness probe
- ``/api/backend``   — active backend info
- ``/api/pages``     — registered Dash pages, sortable list

These show up in Swagger UI at ``/docs`` and ReDoc at ``/redoc`` because
each route declares a Pydantic ``response_model``.
